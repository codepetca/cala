# ADR-0001: UI Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-09-08

## Context

The Trip Planner application requires a robust, accessible, and maintainable UI system that supports:
- Responsive design across desktop and mobile devices
- Dark/light theme support
- High accessibility standards
- AI-assisted development workflow
- Component reusability and consistency
- Tree-shakable bundle optimization
- Real-time collaboration features

We evaluated several UI framework options including Chakra UI, Material-UI (MUI), and a custom solution using TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Radix primitives.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui + Radix UI + Lucide Icons** as our UI stack for the following reasons:

### Primary Stack Components:
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui**: Copy-pasteable component library built on Radix primitives
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Tree-shakable icon library with consistent design
- **next-themes**: Theme management for dark/light mode support

## Rationale

### Advantages of Selected Stack:

1. **Accessibility First**: Radix UI primitives provide excellent accessibility out-of-the-box with proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

2. **AI-Editable**: TailwindCSS classes are semantic and easily understood by AI assistants, making the codebase highly maintainable through AI-assisted development.

3. **Tree-Shakable**: All components and icons can be imported individually, ensuring optimal bundle size and performance.

4. **Full Control**: shadcn/ui components are copied into the project, allowing complete customization without being locked into a framework's design decisions.

5. **Performance**: Utility-first approach reduces CSS bundle size and enables better caching strategies.

6. **Developer Experience**: Excellent TypeScript support, IntelliSense, and development tooling.

7. **Consistency**: Design system approach ensures UI consistency across the application.

8. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend and customize components while maintaining design system coherence.

### Alternatives Considered:

#### Chakra UI
- **Pros**: Good component library, theme support
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size, less AI-editable, runtime theme system overhead
- **Decision**: Rejected due to bundle size and AI development concerns

#### Material-UI (MUI)
- **Pros**: Comprehensive component set, mature ecosystem
- **Cons**: Opinionated design, larger bundle, complex theming system
- **Decision**: Rejected due to design constraints and complexity

#### Pure Tailwind + Custom Components
- **Pros**: Maximum flexibility, small bundle
- **Cons**: Significant development overhead, accessibility concerns
- **Decision**: Rejected due to accessibility and development time requirements

## Implementation Details

### Component Organization:
- `@/components/ui/*` - shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- `@/components/app/*` - Application-specific components (AppShell, ThemeToggle, etc.)
- `@/lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions including cn() for class merging

### Key Patterns:
- Import Lucide icons by name: `import { Plus, Settings } from 'lucide-react'`
- Use Radix portal components with proper z-index for modals/dropdowns
- Convex hooks only in client components marked with `'use client'`
- Theme support through next-themes with class-based strategy

### Accessibility Standards:
- All interactive elements support keyboard navigation
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Focus management in modals and dropdowns
- Screen reader compatibility

## Consequences

### Positive:
- Faster development with AI assistance
- Excellent accessibility standards
- Optimal performance and bundle size
- Full design system control
- Future-proof architecture

### Negative:
- Initial setup and learning curve
- Need to maintain component library
- Custom component development for complex use cases

### Migration:
- Existing components will be gradually migrated to the new system
- Legacy CSS classes will be phased out in favor of Tailwind utilities
- Component API compatibility will be maintained during transition

## Compliance

This stack ensures compliance with:
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Modern web performance best practices
- Tree-shaking optimization requirements
- AI-assisted development workflows
- Enterprise maintainability standards

## Review

This decision will be reviewed in 6 months or when significant new UI framework options become available.
